    "# Computer Vision to Classify Retail Clothing\n",

    "- ```Why lightweight?``` For scalability in larger retail organisations. \n",
    "- ```Learning Objective:``` To get a grasp of using CV in the retail industry. \n",
    "- ```what are the results (from a non-technical perspective):``` It reduces the manual handeing of identifying what type of clothing a specific item is. \n",
    "- ```What is the impact of using this?``` To use this we can reduce the number of employees classifying where to send a returned item, reducing costs and increasing profits.  \n",
