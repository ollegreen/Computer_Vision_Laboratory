# The Computer Vision Lab

*Let's get down and dirty with CL using some popular frameworks on the same task and see how they differ.*

## Info
- This is a repo to explore different deep learning models and their use-cases. 
- No copy pasting from other repos, only dirty code that you built yourself.
- **Trial & Error is the key concept here.**
- ```Goal:``` Be able to build these models from scratch in Keras, PyTorch or Tensorflow and apply it to fun problems 

<br/>

### Libraries we will check out
- **PyTorch** -- Based on recommendation, this seems to be the most prominent one on kaggle competitions and real life applications. However, it seems to have a steep learning curve, but my plan is to start with PyTorch and then proceeding to tensorflow 2.0 and finally keras, would make it easier to understand the TF and Keras as they seem to be a bit easier to digest than PyTorch. 
- **Tensorflow 2.0** -- TF2 (not the game ;)) seems to be the next area worth diving into for CV Neural Nets. 
- **Keras** 

<br/>

## TO-DO:
* Start with getting the fundamentals of pytorch before going into the easier ones --> Tensorflow and Keras. 
* Emphasise when to use clustering, decision trees etc - https://dzone.com/articles/decision-trees-vs-clustering-algorithms-vs-linear
* Clustering vs CLassification - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-in-machine-learning/
* Pushup cv = reward, when you do 30 pushups in front of the ML-camera -> you get a reward https://youtu.be/x31c9FYypOs

# Concepts
## What is a tensor? 
In accordance with [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/investigating-tensors-pytorch);

* **A Pytorch tensor is**:  a multi-dimensional matrix containing elements of a single data type.

* **How do we use the PyTorch Tensors?** Basically, Tensors are a type of data structure used in linear algebra, and like vectors and matrices, you can calculate arithmetic operations with tensors.

* **But how does calculating arithmetic operations help us build cool computer vision models and Deep Learning models?** Good Question! Think of it as 

![tensor](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_D5ZvufDS38WkhK9rK32hQ.jpeg)

A tensor is the basic building block of modern machine learning. At its core, it's a data container. Mostly it contains numbers. Sometimes it even includes strings, but that is rare. ***So think of it as a bucket of numbers.***



* **but what are data structures?** Basically;

1. Linear: arrays, lists, 
2. Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning etc.
3. Hash: distributed hash table, hash tree etc.
4. Graphs: decision, directed, acyclic etc.
