# The Computer Vision Lab

*Let's get down and dirty with CL using some popular frameworks on the same task and see how they differ.* 
- **Keras**
- **Tensorflow 2.0**
- **PyTorch**

# Info
- This is a repo to explore different deep learning models and their use-cases. 
- No copy pasting from other repos, only dirty code that you built yourself.
- **Trial & Error is the key concept here.**
- ```Goal:``` Be able to build these models from scratch in Keras, PyTorch or Tensorflow and apply it to fun problems

Let's go.
