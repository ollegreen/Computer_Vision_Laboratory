# The Computer Vision Lab

*Let's get down and dirty with CL using some popular frameworks on the same task and see how they differ.* 
- **PyTorch** -- Based on recommendation, this seems to be the most prominent one on kaggle competitions and real life applications. However, it seems to have a steep learning curve, but my plan is to start with PyTorch and then proceeding to tensorflow 2.0 and finally keras, would make it easier to understand the TF and Keras as they seem to be a bit easier to digest than PyTorch. 
- **Tensorflow 2.0** -- TF2 (not the game ;)) seems to be the next area worth diving into for CV Neural Nets. 
- **Keras**

# Info
- This is a repo to explore different deep learning models and their use-cases. 
- No copy pasting from other repos, only dirty code that you built yourself.
- **Trial & Error is the key concept here.**
- ```Goal:``` Be able to build these models from scratch in Keras, PyTorch or Tensorflow and apply it to fun problems

## TO-DO:
* Start with getting the fundamentals of pytorch before going into the easier ones --> Tensorflow and Keras. 
* Emphasise when to use clustering, decision trees etc - https://dzone.com/articles/decision-trees-vs-clustering-algorithms-vs-linear
* Clustering vs CLassification - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-in-machine-learning/

Let's go.
