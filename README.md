# The Computer Vision Lab

*Let's get down and dirty with CL using some popular frameworks.*

# Info
- This is a repo to explore different deep learning models and their use-cases. 
- No copy pasting from other repos, only dirty code that you built yourself.
- **Trial & Error is the key concept here.**
- ```Goal:``` Be able to build these models from scratch in Keras, PyTorch or Tensorflow and apply it to fun problems

Let's go.

# Classifying Retail Clothing using Keras

*Let's classify pictures of clothing to make it easier for retail organisations to know where to send the package internally after a customer has returned a piece of clothing.*

## Main Goal
- ```Main Goal:``` Make a lightweight program to classify retail clothing using Keras.
- ```Why lightweight?``` For scalability in larger retail organisations. 
- ```Learning Objective:``` To get a grasp of using CV in the retail industry. 
- ```what are the results (from a non-technical perspective):``` It reduces the manual handeing of identifying what type of clothing a specific item is. 
- ```What is the impact of using this?``` To use this we can reduce the number of employees classifying where to send a returned item, reducing costs and increasing profits.
